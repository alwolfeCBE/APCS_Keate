<p><strong>NumberPalindrome</strong></p>

<p>A palindrome is a number or word that is the same frontwards as it is backwards. For example, "racecar" is spelled the
same from right to left as it is from left to right. Another word palindrom is "mom". Two examples of number palindromes are
"121" and "1221". You will determine whether a given number 3 or 4 digit number is a palindrome.<p>

    <strong>Assignment:</strong>
<p></p>1. After <strong>reverse</strong> in <strong>isPalidrome3Digits</strong>, calculate the last digit and call it <strong>digit1</strong>.
<p></p>2.	Set <strong>reverse</strong> to the last <strong>digit1</strong>.
<p></p>3.	Update <strong>num</strong> so that it does <strong>not</strong> include <strong>digit1</strong>.
<p></p>4.	Calculate the new last digit and call it <strong>digit2</strong>.
<p></p>5.	Calculate <strong>reverse</strong> as <strong>digit1</strong> and <strong>digit2</strong> in that order.
<p></p>6.	Update <strong>num</strong> so that it does <strong>not</strong> include <strong>digit2</strong>.
<p></p>>7.	Calculate the new last digit and call it <strong>digit3</strong>.
<p></p>8.	Calculate <strong>reverse</strong> as <strong>digit1</strong>, <strong>digit2</strong>, and <strong>digit3</strong> in that order.
<p></p>9.	Concatenate <strong>pally</strong> and <strong>number</strong> into the String such that it reads: <strong>It is pally number is a palindrome.</strong>
    with values filled in for <strong>pally</strong> and <strong>number</strong>.
<p></p>10.	Use the code from <strong>isPalidrome3Digits</strong> to do the same thing in <strong>isPalidrome4Digits</strong> but change the code to include code to manage a fourth digit.
<p></p>11.	Verify that the program runs correctly for the given values: <strong>121</strong>, <strong>122</strong>, <strong>1221</strong>, <strong>1213</strong>.
<p></p>12.  Comment your name near the top of your source code.

<div class="hint">
  Our number system is base 10. This means you will need to use the number 10 frequently in this lab.
    Think about how you can use 10 to isolate digits, update numbers once you isolate digits, and create new numbers.
    Each of these tasks requires a different mathematical operation using 10.
