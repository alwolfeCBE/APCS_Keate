<p><strong>Cipher Disk</strong></p>

<p>Spies have used cipher disks for centuries to send coded messages to each other. One type of cipher disk has inner
    and outer disks that rotate to help create a cryptogram, a secret message. The disks set the letters to a code by
    setting <strong>A</strong> to another letter. All letters follow the same pattern. For example, if <strong>A</strong>
    is set to <strong>E</strong>, <strong>B</strong> would be set to <strong>F</strong>, <strong>C</strong> would be set
    to <strong>G</strong>, and so on. You can read more about the cipher disk in this document from the
    <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2021/Jul/13/2002761508/-1/-1/0/THE_CIPHER_DISK-OP.PDF">U.S. Department of Defense</a>.

<strong>Assignment:</strong>
<p></p>    1.	Write a program to create a cryptogram given a start letter and a phrase. Use the comments to help guide you
when coding your cryptogram.
<div class="hint">
    What objects have are their <strong>instance variables</strong>. What they do are their <strong>methods</strong>.
</div>
<div class="hint">
    Be sure to remember to use the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/common/handouts/ascii.html">ASCII code</a>
    values to help you translate phrase into the coded message.
</div>
<div class="hint">
    You will need to use <strong>String</strong> methods, which can be found in its <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html">API</a>.
</div>
<p></p>2.	Verify  the program works using a CipherDisk with the following information:
<p></p><style>
table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
</style>
<body>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Start Letter</th>
        <th>Message</th>
        <th>Cyptogram</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>U</td>
        <td>MEET ME AT MIDNIGHT</td>
        <td>GYYN GY UN GCXHCABN</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>L</td>
        <td>THE EAGLE HAS LANDED</td>
        <td>ESP PLRWP SLD WLYOPO</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>B</td>
        <td>TURTLES SWIM TUESDAY</td>
        <td>UVSUMFT TXJN UVFTEBZ</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</body>
