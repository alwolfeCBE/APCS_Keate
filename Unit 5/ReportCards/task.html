<p><strong>Report Cards</strong></p>

<p>Schools have different parameters for eligibility for extracurricular activities based on students' grades. Often times,
eligibility has multiple dependencies, not just GPA. Suppose a school has the following terms of eligibility terms:
<br><strong>1. A student must be taking 4 or more classes.
<br>2. A student must have a GPA of over 2.0.
<br>3. A student must not have any F's. </strong>
<p></p>In order for a student to be eligible for extracurricular activities, all of these terms must be true.
<p></p>
<strong>Assignment:</strong>
<br>    Write a program to find a person's GPA and eligibility status when given their grades. The program must print out
a student's GPA and eligibility status along with a specific statement explaining ineligibility (if one is ineligible).
<p></p>The following table shows some examples of different cases with the specific phrase that must be printed.

    <tr>
        <th>GPA:</th>
        <th>Number of classes</th>
        <th>F's</th>

        <td>No</td>
        <td>GPA: 4.0, Ineligible, taking less than 4 classes.</td>

        <td>3.0</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>Yes</td>
        <td>GPA: 3.0, Ineligible, GPA above 2.0 but has an F grade.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>1.8</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>No</td>

1. Code the constructor with parameters.
2.  Create the necessary getter methods to make sure the instance variables are accessible.
<p></p>
3. Write the method, <strong>eligibility</strong>, to <strong>return a String</strong>. The <strong>String</strong>
must follow the table above - any different formatting will cause the <strong>Check</strong> button below to print
<strong>Incorrect</strong>. Be aware that number of classes supersedes any of the other eligibility requirements.
<div class="hint">
    Be aware that taking 4 or more classes supersedes any of the other eligibility requirements. In other words, if a student
    is only taking 3 classes and has a 1.8, <strong>eligibility</strong> should return the phrase:
    <br><strong>GPA: 1.8, Ineligible, taking less than 4 classes.</strong>
</div>
4. Code the beginning of the client class. You will need to declare the gpa, number of classes, and whether there are F grades
and initialize them to default values. Then, you should read the grades in one by one until a person enters an invalid grade (only
A, B, C, D, and F) are valid grades. You should calculate the <strong>gpa</strong>, change <strong>hasF</strong> to true if an F
is entered, and set <strong>numClasses</strong> to however many grades are entered.
<div class="hint">
    Remember to use a loop to read in the grades and update your variables!
</div>
<div class="hint">
    The <strong>Scanner</strong> class cannot read in <strong>chars</strong>, so read the user input in as <strong>Strings</strong>.
</div>
5. Create a <strong>ReportCards</strong> object with the values read in to test <strong>all</strong> the
eligibility requirements by printing the eligibility statements. Your program will need to be run and tested multiple times.</strong>
The following table holds test values and their expected results.
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Grades:</th>
        <th>Eligibility Statement: </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>A, A, A, B, F</td>
        <td>GPA: 3.0, Ineligible, GPA above 2.0 but has an F grade.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>A, A, A</td>
        <td>GPA: 4.0, Ineligible, taking less than 4 classes.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>F, F, D, D</td>
        <td>GPA: 0.5, Ineligible, GPA below 2.0 and has an F grade.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>C, B, D, D</td>
        <td>GPA: 1.75, Ineligible, GPA below 2.0.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>A, B, C, A</td>
        <td>GPA: 3.25, Eligible</td>
    </tr>

6. Make sure your name is commented out near the top of your source code.
