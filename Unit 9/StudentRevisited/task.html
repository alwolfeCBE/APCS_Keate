<p><strong>School Revisited</strong></p>
<p>We have looked at students throughout this semester but not through the lens of inheritance. You are given the
    <strong>Teacher</strong> and <strong>Student</strong> classes to help you write the remainder of the of the <strong>CollegeStudent</strong>,
    <strong>PhDStudent</strong>, and <strong>Teacher</strong> classes.
<p></p>
<strong>Assignment:</strong>
<br>In this lab, you will be focusing on the
<strong>CollegeStudent</strong>, <strong>PhDStudent</strong>, and <strong>Teacher</strong> classes. Examine the
<strong>Person</strong> and <strong>Student</strong> and make the necessary changes to the other classes so they work as
intended.
<p></p>
1. Complete the class header and constructor of the <strong>Teacher</strong> class. <strong>Teacher</strong> is a subclass
of <strong>Person</strong>.
<p></p>
<div class="hint">
    You will need to use the super constructor and initialize a <strong>Teacher</strong>'s new variables, <strong>subject</strong>
    and <strong>salary</strong>.
</div>
<p></p>
2. Complete the <strong>getter</strong>, <strong>setter</strong>, and <strong>toString</strong> methods for the <strong>Teacher</strong> class.
The <strong>setter</strong> methods should not return anything.
<p></p>
<div class="hint">
    When overriding the <strong>toString</strong> method, be sure to use the superclass's <strong>toString</strong> method.
</div>
<p></p>
3. Complete the class header and constructor of the <strong>CollegeStudent</strong> class. <strong>CollegeStudent</strong> is a subclass
of <strong>Student</strong>.
<p></p>
<div class="hint">
    You will need to use the super constructor and initialize a <strong>CollegeStudent</strong>'s new variables, <strong>year</strong>
    and <strong>major</strong>.
</div>
<p></p>
4.  Complete the <strong>getter</strong>, <strong>setter</strong>, and <strong>toString</strong> methods for the <strong>CollegeStudent</strong> class.
The <strong>setter</strong> methods should not return anything.
<p></p>
<div class="hint">
    When overriding the <strong>toString</strong> method, be sure to use the superclass's <strong>toString</strong> method.
</div>
<p></p>
5. Complete the class header and constructor of the <strong>PhDStudent</strong> class. <strong>PhDStudent</strong> is a subclass
of <strong>CollegeStudent</strong>.
<p></p>
<div class="hint">
    You will need to use the super constructor and initialize a <strong>PhDStudent</strong>'s new variables, <strong>thesisTitle</strong>,
    <strong>isTeaching</strong> and <strong>classTeaching</strong>.
</div>
<p></p>
6. Complete the <strong>getter</strong>, <strong>setter</strong>, and <strong>toString</strong> methods for the <strong>PhDStudent</strong> class.
The <strong>setter</strong> methods should not return <anything class=""></anything>
<p></p>
<div class="hint">
    When overriding the <strong>toString</strong> method, be sure to use the superclass's <strong>toString</strong> method.
</div>
<p></p>
7. Complete the <strong>writesThesis</strong> method for the <strong>PhDStudent</strong> class.
<p></p>
<div class="hint">
    <strong>writesThesis</strong> updates <strong>totalStudyHours</strong> to include the number of hours spent writing
    the thesis. <strong>totalStudyHours</strong> is a <strong>private</strong> instance variable of the <strong>Student</strong>
    class. Think about how you will be able to do this with restricted access.
</div>
<p></p>
8. Complete the <strong>StudentRevisited</strong> class. A <strong>Teacher</strong> and two <strong>Student</strong>s
have already been created. Add the <strong>Student</strong>s to the list. Then, make <strong>phD</strong> write a his thesis
for 3 hours. Then, print out the <strong>Teacher</strong>. Print out the <strong>Student</strong>s using a loop.
<p></p>
<div class="hint">
    When adding objects from a list, you may want to access the <strong>ArrayList</strong>
    class methods found in its
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ArrayList.html">API</a>.
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="hint">
    When making the <strong>PhDStudent</strong> write his thesis, remember that he is declared as a <strong>Student</strong>.
    What will you need to do to ensure the appropriate method is called properly?
</div>
<p></p>
9. Verify your code works. The following table holds test values and their expected results.
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Person Creation</th>
        <th>Method Call</th>
        <th>Expected Results</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Teacher mrJava = new Teacher("Duke Java", 34, "M", "Computer Science", 50000);</td>
        <td>String teacher = mrJava.toString()</td>
        <td>teacher should hold <strong>"Duke Java, age: 34, gender: M, subject: Computer Science, salary: 50000.0"</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>CollegeStudent ima = new CollegeStudent("Ima Frosh", 18, "F", "UCB123", 4.0, 0,1, "English");</td>
        <td>String collegeStudent = ima.toString()</td>
        <td>collegeStudents should hold <strong>"Ima Frosh, age: 18, gender: F, student ID: UCB123, GPA: 4.0, total study hours: 0.0, year: 1, major: English"</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>PhDStudent phD = new PhDStudent("Ima PhD Student", 27, "M", "UCB567", 4.0, 100,6, "Education", "Inclusion and Diversity Throughout the Curriculum", true, "Philosophy of Education");</td>
        <td>phD.writesThesis(3);</td>
        <td>This is a void method, so nothing is returned.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td>String phDStudent = phD.toString()</td>
        <td>phDStudent should hold <strong>"Ima PhD Student, age: 27, gender: M, student ID: UCB567, GPA: 4.0, total study hours: 103.0, year: 6, major: Education, thesis title: Inclusion and Diversity Throughout the Curriculum, It is true that I am teaching. class teaching: Philosophy of Education"</strong></td>
    </tr>

10. Make sure your name is commented near the top of your source code and use the given <strong>StudentRevisited</strong>
class to test the accuracy of your code. You may alter this class to fit your needs and test appropriately.
